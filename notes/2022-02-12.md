## Big Idea
- There are a bunch of decisions that have to be made
- 1. Where to put notes
  - 1. Microsoft / Teams / OneNote (WYSIWYG)
    2. Gitlab / Wiki (Markdown)
    3. Repo / Docs Directory (Markdown)
    4. Repo / Obsidian Directory (Modified Markdown)
    5. Repo / Code Directory (Markdown) (Place Notes alongside code) (Requires rigor regarding linking/dating of notes)
    6. Repo / Docs Directory (ReStructured Text) (More Popular with Python projects, better formatting/structural writing)
- 2. Code of Conduct
- 3. Contributing Guidelines
  - Where are the discussions for this?
- 4. Issue Templates
  - What formats to use? What do people find useful?
- 5. Which Platform to use (EvaP or Sakai)
  - Need to ask Jeff Salvage about difficulty of maintaining adapters
- 6. How to Merge Notes
  - Already scattered all over the damn place
  - Need to merge - how?
  - Also bear in mind use of Discord as a "temporary notes platform"
- 7. Required Qualities of Notes
  - What do people find useful/necessary?
  - Ability to simultaneously edit notes online at same time has been very popular recently
  - Thus promoting the use of in-browser microsoft word
  - Also note pattern of only one person taking notes
- 8. Purpose of Repository
  - If direct contributions to EvaP/Sakai are intended, how to go about doing so?
- 9. Who are the Notes for
  - External/Public? Put in `docs/` directory (and not notes)
  - [(Example) Gitlab Docs Folder](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/tree/master/doc)
