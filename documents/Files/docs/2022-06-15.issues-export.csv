Choose A Front End Framework,"## Problem Statement
We need to decide on a Front End framework to use for developing our application. 

## Who will benefit?
Team

## Benefits and risks
This brings more clarity on to what tech stack we are using. We will be able to start learning or priming our brains for the upcoming development. The only risk this will bring is that we are going to finalize our tech stack and that closes a lot of options for us, as we can only use one front end framework.

## Proposed solution
We should meet up as a group for 30 minutes and discuss the exploratory research we did on front end frameworks (found on a previous ticket).

Design The Screen Flow Diagram With Screens/Pages We'll Need,"## Problem Statement
We need designs for our requirements. These designs will help us implement by giving us more direction and clarity.

## Who will benefit?
Team

## Benefits and risks
This gives us a clear picture of every page in our upcoming project. It is easier to implement off of designs rather than just requirements. It gives us a visual to look at so we are all on the same page.

## Proposed solution
The assigned person will either design all of the screens and screen flow diagram using a software like Figma, or draw it with pen and paper. This can also be assigned to more than one person.

## Deliverable
A Screen Flow Diagram with Low Fidelity Prototypes.

Clarify Intent of Project,"## Problem Statement
- There exists ambiguity regarding what the purpose of this project is
- Is this an effort to **improve** some open source project?
- Is this an effort to **incorporate** some open source project?
- What, fundamentally, is the intent?
- Per [details in the syllabus...](#the-syllabus) (Bold sections indicate ambiguity)
- More clarity onto expectations of contributions are required.
- Justification of why 12 issues (2.4 issues per team member) desired, as opposed to selection of 1-2 issues on the open source project's own issue tracker
- This especially applies to addressing the requirement ""only issues that directly advance the project"" and underlying ambiguity
- Additional requirements/expectations of system may also be desired
- There currently exists a major split in issues regarding **improving EvaP** or **making modifications**

## The Syllabus
> - Explain the impact openness has on open source software products, processes, and business models
> - Discuss particular examples of social impact achieved by HFOSS projects
> - Assess the health of an open source project
> - **Interact with an HFOSS project community in a way that demonstrates understanding of the projectâ€™s communication and control mechanisms**
> - Complete the steps needed to **contribute to one particular HFOSS project including tool use and process steps**

Conduct preliminary analysis on backend technologies,"## Problem Statement
Team needs some understanding on what the backend technologies will be which the course evaluation system will be built on top of.

## Who will benefit?
Team and developers

## Proposed solution
Team member conducts an analysis on what technologies EvaP's backend is built off of and performs an analysis of whether that technology would be a good fit for the project.

## Deliverable
Document with list of backend technologies used by EvaP and a preliminary analysis on the viability of the those technologies in the project. Document will also offer alternatives (if applicable) for technologies to build the software's backend infrastructure.

Research Alternatives To VirtualBox For M1 Macbooks,"## Problem Statement
VirtualBox, a virtual machine that EvaP uses for its development environment, is not able to be run on non-intel Macbooks (M1).

## Who will benefit?
M1 Macbook users who want to contribute to EvaP.

## Benefits and risks
The benefits are that a whole community of developers who use the M1 macbooks will be able to contribute to the EvaP project. No risks are introduced as users can choose not to install whatever software we end up using and just resort to VirtualBox.

## Proposed solution
Research and use an alternative to VirtualBox.

## Deliverable
Changes to the README that indicate how M1 macbook users can use an alternative to VirtualBox.

Research Docker vs VirtualBox as a Virtual Machine,"## Problem Statement
We are trying to compare VirtualBox to Docker to see what is a better option for EvaP long term. There are already issues with VirtualBox for the new M1 mac books.

## Who will benefit?
It will benefit anyone working on the EvaP project in the future. It will especially benefit M1 mac book users if we end up with Docker as the better answer.

## Benefits and risks
It will bring a community of M1 mac book users who want to contribute to EvaP.

## Proposed solution
We should research and compare Docker with VirtualBox.

## Deliverable
A report or pros and cons list of Docker vs VirtualBox.

## Comparison
https://www.smarthomebeginner.com/what-is-docker-docker-vs-virtualbox/

Docker: 
1. Docker can already run Intel VMs on Apple Silicon. 
2. Docker is becoming increasingly popular which leads to more support long term. 
3. Docker offers the ability to run multiple applications within the same host operating system, sharing underlying resources. 
4. Docker has more functionality and it is more efficient at running apps. 
5. Docker is better for running apps and services in containers because it is faster and easier. 
6. As good as Docker is, it can't replace a virtual machine.

VirtualBox: 
1. VirtualBox is good for virtual machines because it allows you to install a complete operating system while in Docker you don't have the full functionality of an operating system. 
2. Creating virtual machines take a relatively long time while Dockers can be created in seconds. 
3. Virtual machines are generally bigger in size compared to Docker because they contain a whole operating system underneath.

Overall for EvaP, it looks like Docker is better because of its increasing support and higher efficiency. We do not need a whole virtual machine to run EvaP, as we can isolate it to just the web application.",27,https://gitlab.cci.drexel.edu/courseeval/team-blue/-/issues/27,Closed,Hoang Nguyen,hn374,"","",No,No,,2022-03-04 22:25:15,2022-03-05 02:24:05,2022-03-04 22:42:56,,,,0,0

Conduct exploration into adding additional filters and categories for evaluation,"## Problem Statement
EvaP currently only classifies evaluations into a limited number of categories. These categories can be expanded to better match Drexel's course load. Additional categories can include the various majors that Drexel offers (ex. Computer Science, Software Engineering) and the classes within each major (ex. CS260, SSE420). This functionality would make the course evaluation system more applicable to Drexel's situation.

## Who will benefit?
Drexel IT Staff
Team

## Benefits and risks

What benefits does this bring?
- Course evaluations system that better aligns with Drexel's course catologue
        
What risks might this introduce?
- Changing codebase may affect other features
- May make changes to the code base that are difficult to repair


## Proposed solution
Team members conduct exploratory research in EvaP's codebase to determine how additional functionality for filters and categories would be implemented.

## Deliverable
Short summary/report that addresses the following questions:
- Which portion of the code contributes to EvaP's filter feature?
- Which portion of the code assigns categories to each evaluation?
- How would we implement functionality to include Drexel's course catologue?

Extract Customization to Folder,"## Problem Statement

Lots of banners, banner logos, user names, default names, background colors, and other items are hard-coded into the EvaP application. To make this application useful to Drexel, these customizations need to be changed.

## Who will benefit?
- Our Team
- Future Drexel Users
- E-Valuation's Team
- Other EvaP Users

## Benefits and risks
- May be a massive time sink
- May be dull work
- May significantly improve application robustness (reduce errors, especially with renaming operations)

## Proposed solution
As opposed to just directly modifying the values (and potentially missing a few), we should instead investigate how difficult it would instead be to express these items in terms of plaintext configs and from a central ""customization"" folder.

The advantage of this is that the ""customization"" folder can be excluded from the EvaP fork, and each forking organization can provide their own customizations, rather than needing to overwrite the E-Valuation team's customizations.

## Deliverable
- A Word Document in the `docs/` folder on OneDrive
- A new branch on Drexel's EvaP Fork

Create Dockerfile For The Container,"## Problem Statement
We need to use Docker to create containers for users who can't use VirtualBox.

## Who will benefit?
This will benefit all users who want to use Docker.

## Benefits and risks
Creating a Dockerfile makes it so that the repository and virtual environment are easily recreatable on each machine. 

## Proposed solution
Create the Dockerfile with all the needed images as commands.

## Deliverable
A Dockerfile.
