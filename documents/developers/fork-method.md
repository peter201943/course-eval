# Fork Method

The forking model of development has one major consideration:

## MAKE MINIMAL CHANGES ONLY

The whole point of forking is to be able to merge the change *back into* the forked project.

When miscellaneous files (such as the README, or the docs) are changed, these will appear in the merge request.

To avoid these unwanted changes from appearing, it is important ***to not change these files***.

With the setup of EvaP, it is highly recommended that you use **branches** for each of your merge-requests, and use a **separate repo** for any non-critical items (documents, issues, etcetera).
