## Going Forward

### Not enough time to spend time investigating and voting
- Peter: [Played around with Sakai at this URL](https://experimental.nightly.sakaiproject.org/portal/site/99949356-ae19-41c3-9bf8-67a704c47e44/tool/f123b3d2-d816-4531-97db-094e629767e9/add)
  - (Username: `pjm`, Password: `12345`)
- Peter: See the "Tests & Quizzes" tab for the "Evaluation"
- Peter: I think the evaluation system only works from inside Sakai (lot of system to support for one feature)
- Peter: Their form-builder also appears to be lacking
- Peter: As such, I do not recommend us trying to contribute to it

### Need Better Issue Templates
- Peter: I can spend time on this, what would we like on it?

### Reaching out to the University of Potsdam
- Peter: I intend to do this, any considerations/objections?
