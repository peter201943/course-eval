## Message
E-Valuation Contributions (International)

Dear Mr. Wolf,

Hello! I am Peter, an American college student in Pennsylvania studying at Drexel University.

I am taking a class on "Open Source Software Engineering",
and we need to contribute to an open-source course-evaluation-system for a whole month.

I came across your course-evaluation project on GitHub and thought it was one of 
the best course-evaluation systems I could find (https://github.com/e-valuation/EvaP).
My apologies if you are the wrong person or not the primary-maintainer,
I tried to find who was the primary contributor based off who made the most commits.

I am representing a team of five students who would like to contribute to your project.
We are planning on going after issues listed in your issue tracker on GitHub,
and figured we would let you know, so that you would not be surprised.

We have forked your project to a public GitLab instance and plan to make 
pull requests to your repo using our personal GitHub accounts.
- Our Fork: https://gitlab.cci.drexel.edu/courseeval/EvaP
- Our Planning Repo: https://gitlab.cci.drexel.edu/courseeval/team-blue
- My GitHub: https://github.com/peter201943

I have CC'd our professor (Dr. Hislop) and my teammates.
There are some other Drexel student teams also working on course-evaluation-systems,
but they have not committed to any one system yet.

I am sorry I could not write to you in German, it has been too many years since I lived there.

Fr√∂hlichen Dienstag!

Thank You,

Peter

## Forgot to Include
- We were thinking of first contributing to your documents, specifically with improving your readme with some screenshots
- We setup a Discord for our class (you can access here), do you have a chat-room setup for EvaP that we could participate in?
