## Big Idea
- There are a bunch of decisions that have to be made
- 1. Where to put notes
  - 1. Microsoft / Teams / OneNote (WYSIWYG)
    2. Gitlab / Wiki (Markdown)
    3. Repo / Docs Directory (Markdown)
    4. Repo / Obsidian Directory (Modified Markdown)
    5. Repo / Code Directory (Markdown) (Place Notes alongside code) (Requires rigor regarding linking/dating of notes)
    6. Repo / Docs Directory (ReStructured Text) (More Popular with Python projects, better formatting/structural writing)
- 2. Code of Conduct
- 3. Contributing Guidelines
  - Where are the discussions for this?
- 4. Issue Templates
  - What formats to use? What do people find useful?
- 5. Which Platform to use (EvaP or Sakai)
  - Need to ask Jeff Salvage about difficulty of maintaining adapters
- 6. How to Merge Notes
  - Already scattered all over the damn place
  - Need to merge - how?
  - - SE420 FA22Q2 Teams OneNote Notebook (This will probably continue to see use, especially regarding sensitive information)
    - ~~Peter's Google Keep (In Progress Download and Transfer)~~ (No Longer Relevant/Needed)
    - ~~Peter's Personal Notes (In Progress Transfer)~~ (No Longer Relevant/Needed)
    - Also bear in mind use of Discord as a "temporary notes platform"
  - Eh, for now, not of concern
- 7. Required Qualities of Notes
  - What do people find useful/necessary?
  - Ability to simultaneously edit notes online at same time has been very popular recently
  - Thus promoting the use of in-browser microsoft word
  - Also note pattern of only one person taking notes
- 8. Purpose of Repository
  - If direct contributions to EvaP/Sakai are intended, how to go about doing so?
- 9. Who are the Notes for
  - External/Public? Put in `docs/` directory (and not notes)
  - [(Example) Gitlab Docs Folder](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/tree/master/doc)

- [(Resource) Creative Commons Logos](https://creativecommons.org/about/downloads/)
- [(Resource) Creative Commons Markdown](https://github.com/idleberg/Creative-Commons-Markdown)
- [(Discussion) Should I call my license file LICENSE, LICENSE.md, or LICENSE.txt? [closed]](https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/10239/should-i-call-my-license-file-license-license-md-or-license-txt)
- [(Discussion) Does it matter what I name my open source license file? [closed]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16627477/does-it-matter-what-i-name-my-open-source-license-file)

- Peter: From what I can tell, most organizations on GitHub or Gitlab write one or the other:
  - Really really basic codes of conduct (just copying the "contributors' covenant")
  - Really, really big codes of conduct (which they then host on their own website)
- Peter: I don't like just copying a code of conduct, and I especially dislike dealing with humans, so I am hesitant about just grabbing the contributors' covenant
  - Eh, whatever...

  - As such, I will put more of an emphasis on team decisions and meetings

## Issue Tags
- [(Example) GodotEngine Issue Labels](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/labels)
- [(Example) GodotEngine Issue Labels](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals/labels)
- Peter personally likes the use of meta-tags to address missing tags (but only when a platform supports ease of applying these tags - which gitlab does not appear to do)
- [(Discussion) How to automatically set a label on each new issue at creation?](https://forum.gitlab.com/t/how-to-automatically-set-a-label-on-each-new-issue-at-creation/37846)
- Should probably reflect process of an issue
  - 1. Unassigned
    2. In-Progress
    3. Blocked
    4. Needs-Reviewing
    5. Merged
- 2022-02-13T00:29:00-04:00 Peter:
  - Created Three Types of Labels:
    - (These are prefixed onto each label)
    - `Status`: What stage of completion a task is in
    - `Task`: What the task activity is
    - `Topic`: What area of work an issue is applicable to
  - [Created these labels](https://gitlab.cci.drexel.edu/courseeval/team-blue/-/labels):
    - [`Status: BLOCKED` "URGENT - This issue is blocked and in need of assistance" Red](https://gitlab.cci.drexel.edu/courseeval/team-blue/-/issues?label_name%5B%5D=Status%3A+BLOCKED)
    - [`Status: FIXME` "There are errors on this issue - either labels are missing, the task is ambiguous, or the issue has been left stagnant" Pink](https://gitlab.cci.drexel.edu/courseeval/team-blue/-/issues?label_name%5B%5D=Status%3A+FIXME)
    - [`Status: In Progress` "This issue is actively being worked on" Bright-Green](https://gitlab.cci.drexel.edu/courseeval/team-blue/-/issues?label_name%5B%5D=Status%3A+In+Progress)
    - [`Status: In Review` "This issue has been assigned to someone for review" Yellow](https://gitlab.cci.drexel.edu/courseeval/team-blue/-/issues?label_name%5B%5D=Status%3A+In+Review)
    - [`Status: Moved` "This issue has been moved into another issue - see Issue for details" Purple](https://gitlab.cci.drexel.edu/courseeval/team-blue/-/issues?label_name%5B%5D=Status%3A+Moved)
    - [`Status: Resolved` "This issue has been successfully closed" Blue](https://gitlab.cci.drexel.edu/courseeval/team-blue/-/issues?label_name%5B%5D=Status%3A+Resolved)
    - [`Status: Unassigned` "This issue is in need of volunteers" Tan](https://gitlab.cci.drexel.edu/courseeval/team-blue/-/issues?label_name%5B%5D=Status%3A+Unassigned)
    - [`Task: Bug` "Something is incorrect and needs to be replaced or fixed"](https://gitlab.cci.drexel.edu/courseeval/team-blue/-/issues?label_name%5B%5D=Task%3A+Bug)
    - [`Task: Improvement` "Something needs new features, capabilities, or design"](https://gitlab.cci.drexel.edu/courseeval/team-blue/-/issues?label_name%5B%5D=Task%3A+Improvement)
    - [`Task: Proposal` "This issue is proposing some new idea"](https://gitlab.cci.drexel.edu/courseeval/team-blue/-/issues?label_name%5B%5D=Task%3A+Proposal)
    - [`Topic: Class` "Some requirement from the SE420 class"](https://gitlab.cci.drexel.edu/courseeval/team-blue/-/issues?label_name%5B%5D=Topic%3A+Class)
    - [`Topic: Docs` "Written specification for something is needed"](https://gitlab.cci.drexel.edu/courseeval/team-blue/-/issues?label_name%5B%5D=Topic%3A+Docs)
    - [`Topic: External` "Some interaction with a third party is needed - emails, schedules, meetings"](https://gitlab.cci.drexel.edu/courseeval/team-blue/-/issues?label_name%5B%5D=Topic%3A+External)
    - [`Topic: Team` "Organizing, Event Creation, Scheduling, HR, Management"](https://gitlab.cci.drexel.edu/courseeval/team-blue/-/issues?label_name%5B%5D=Topic%3A+Team)
  - Created these boards:
    - [Development](https://gitlab.cci.drexel.edu/courseeval/team-blue/-/boards/1136):
      - Unassigned
      - In Progress
      - BLOCKED
      - In Review
      - Resolved
      - Moved
      - FIXME

## Issue Management
- Milestones
- Boards
- Due Dates

## Current Issues
- What things need to immediately get done/have a physical impact?

## Misc
- Peter: Creating `res/` folder for static objects
- [(Example) NodeJS "Governance.Md"](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md)
- [(Example) GodotEngine Bug Report Issues](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues) is intended more for immediate technical-issues
- [(Example) GodotEngine Feature Enhancement Issues](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals/issues) is intended more for extended-discussion
- [(Example) GodotEngine developers tend to organize in an adhoc manner, primarily through text-chat](https://chat.godotengine.org/channel/general)
- [(Article) Gitlab Badges](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/badges.html)
- GitLab does not support badges on private instances (the `gitlab.cci.drexel.edu` instance as example)
- Will just use regular badges as result

## Working Style
- Peter: For *this* repo (the team), branching style will probably be best style to use
- Peter: For the *external project*, an entirely new repo is probably most suitable
